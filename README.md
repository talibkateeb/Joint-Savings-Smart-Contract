# Joint-Savings-Smart-Contract

This project is a Solidity Smart Contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
